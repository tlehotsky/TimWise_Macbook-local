    more often than we know—has been suggested by dozens of studies that test people on subjects on which they consider themselves authorities. The people tested answer a series of questions, and then answer this question about each answer: “From one to a hundred percent, how certain are you about this answer?” What happens? On the answers of which people say they are totally—100 percent—certain, they are right only 85 percent of the time. In other words, 15 percent of the time you think you are absolutely certain you are absolutely wrong. In most services, that 15 percent error—those wrong but widespread assumptions that everyone in the company is making—is the most leverageable part of your business. Find it, and attack it.

    How do product manufacturers do it? They offer free home trials, or free money-back guarantees. Can you do that? Often, you can. Instead of asking for the business, ask for a project. Offer to do one shirt, one small survey, one blurb for a newsletter, one small case, one free review of their retirement plan. If it is a big account, ask for a tiny slice—a slice about which Peggy might not worry and on which you can shine. Always remember: Peggy is afraid. The best thing you can do for a prospect is eliminate her fear. Offer a trial period or a test project.

    Selling a service involves personal risks. You can look too pushy. You can be rejected. (No, you will be rejected.) People won’t return your calls. You run the risk of feeling bad when you go home at night. But the rewards of all those efforts will make you wonder: Why didn’t I do that in the first place? Taking risks doesn’t always mean risking your money. Sometimes, it just means risking yourself. Risk yourself.
